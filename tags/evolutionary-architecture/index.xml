Within the context of software architecture, we could view a characteristic as a generalization of one or more traits that can be applied to a wide range of concerns critical to the success of the architecture.</description></item><item><title>Fitness Functions</title><link>https://cloudnativemethods.com/fitness-functions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 21:10:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnativemethods.com/fitness-functions/</guid><description>Provides an objective way to assess a desired architectural characteristic Allows us to compare the software architecture before and after a change is introduced Amplifies feedback loops by using metrics to guide future development An example of fast feedback loop in which pipelines can be modeled to give developers feedback as quickly as possible.
