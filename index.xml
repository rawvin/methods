Empower application operators to deploy services, both stateless and stateful, without human intervention.
Enable a consistent way for services to describe events within event-driven architectures.
Enable safe and optimized default behaviors for platform capabilities wherever possible.
Provide a developer-centric PR based approach towards testing and test frameworks with fast feedback loops.</description></item><item><title>Architectural Characteristics</title><link>https://cloudnativemethods.com/arch-chars/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2020 21:10:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnativemethods.com/arch-chars/</guid><description>Architecture is abstract until it is operationalized. &amp;mdash; Neal Ford Characteristic Vs Trait According to Merriam-Webster&amp;rsquo;s dictionary, one of the definitions of the word characteristic is a quality or property of a person or thing and the definition of the word trait is an inherited characteristic of a person or thing
Within the context of software architecture, we could view a characteristic as a generalization of one or more traits that can be applied to a wide range of concerns critical to the success of the architecture.</description></item><item><title>Fitness Functions</title><link>https://cloudnativemethods.com/fitness-functions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Sep 2020 21:10:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnativemethods.com/fitness-functions/</guid><description>Provides an objective way to assess a desired architectural characteristic Allows us to compare the software architecture before and after a change is introduced Amplifies feedback loops by using metrics to guide future development An example of fast feedback loop in which pipelines can be modeled to give developers feedback as quickly as possible.

They are responsible for describing what a microservice does and how it can be configured. They are typically not concerned with where the micoservice is deployed.
Application Operators Application Operators are domain experts on the platform. They are responsible for configuring the runtim aspects of these microservices. In many use cases, application operator could be the platform itself.</description></item><item><title>Workloads</title><link>https://cloudnativemethods.com/workloads/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 21:23:19 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnativemethods.com/workloads/</guid><description>Container A Container is a workload that runs OCI containers: Docker, containerd, CRI-O.
Functions Functions as in Function as a Service is an event driven model that allows execution of discreet modular code in a serverless computing environment. A few examples of the more commonly deployed Function as a Service (FaaS) platforms include Knative, OpenFaaS and AWS Firecracker.
VM A virtual machine is a workload that operates on top of a hypervisor and contains its own virtualized hardware stack comprising of network adapters, storage, RAM, CPU with applications, binaries, and libraries.</description></item><item><title>Application Delivery</title><link>https://cloudnativemethods.com/app-delivery/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 21:22:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnativemethods.com/app-delivery/</guid><description>Target Goals 1 - Connect all of the software delivery activities to measurable business outcomes.
2 - Empower application operators to deploy services, both stateless and stateful, without human intervention
In order to achieve the above goals, the focus for the application delivery framework should be flow over siloed specializations. The open source OAM spec will be used as the foundational building block on which the framework will be built upon.</description></item><item><title>Performance Engineering</title><link>https://cloudnativemethods.com/perf-eng/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 21:21:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnativemethods.com/perf-eng/</guid><description>Runtime performance optimization Developing libraries and tools for understanding and optimizing runtime performance of different applications. Supporting teams with comprehensive analysis of runtime performance and the implications for overall system performance. Accelarating application performance Standardizing and accelerating parts of the application stack. Analyzing system performance and advising teams on runtime budgets and avoiding performance regressions.

Utility functions that are modular, relatively independent of other code should be verified to work by passing in user-defined inputs.
Automated software testing Increase the depth and scope of tests to improve software quality.
Provide robust automation test frameworks to support execution of different complex test case scenarios.</description></item><item><title>Chaos Engineering</title><link>https://cloudnativemethods.com/chaos-eng/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2020 21:19:59 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cloudnativemethods.com/chaos-eng/</guid><description>Coming soon&amp;hellip;
